# broccoli-webpack

A [Broccoli] plugin for [webpack].

[Broccoli]: https://github.com/joliss/broccoli
[webpack]: https://github.com/webpack/webpack

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev broccoli-webpack
```

## Usage

```js
var webpackify = require('broccoli-webpack');
var js_source = 'src';
var js_bundler = webpackify(inl, {
	entry: './main',
	output: {filename: 'app.js'},
	externals: [{'react': 'React', 'jquery': '$'}],
	devtool: 'source-map'
});
```

Basically, just pass a tree and a normal [webpack config].
`context` and `output.path` will be set automatically.
For everything else, you're on your own :-)
